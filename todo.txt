Prototype:

1) UI prototypes

[:] Token field
  [X] plain text
  [X] encapsed string

  [X] fix backspacing around edges of tokens
!  [ ] add icon/spinner support to tokens
  [ ] caret positions around allowempty tokens and ^/$
  [ ] | and >> token support
  [ ] caret.remove() shouldn't need to touch tokenList when pruning empties -> let triggers do it
  [ ] mouseclick caret is off by ~8px, but only in first token 
  [ ] switch between inline and block tokens -> input vs textarea.
  [ ] fix wrapping of tokens
    
[:] inline autocomplete
  [X] panel overlayed on token
  [X] alignment
  [X] keyboard controls up/down
  [X] hit enter after autocomplete in empty token -> undefined
  [X] escape to close popup
!  [ ] autocomplete icons, markup, widgets, etc
  
[:] command view
  [X] list of collapsible sections
  [X] host token field
  [X] context bar by command
  [X] anchored scrolling
  [X] host output
  [X] make outputnode tree changes reflect in DOM transparently
  [X] fix view.add mid-node insertion
  [X] auto-expand to fill view
  [ ] command history
  [ ] alt-up/down to change focus
  [ ] tabbed views
  [ ] add forking the view with tabs and hosted/nested sessions

2) Command/token autocomplete
  [X] token multi-regexp patterns
  [X] triggers system, unify with token field triggers a bit?
  [X] autocomplete a string / command
  [X] autocomplete empties
  [X] autocomplete commands
  [X] autocomplete filesystem
+  [ ] autocomplete label / contents / icon
!  [ ] autocomplete dir / file distinction
!  [ ] badge tokens with one/many/command icons
