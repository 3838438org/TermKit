Prototype:

1) UI prototypes

[alpha] Token field
  [X] plain text
  [X] encapsed string
  [X] token transmutation
  [X] refactored code into separate files + object literal style
  [X] design mockup
  [X] commandstream mockup
  [X] move validity of selection anchor/focus pos into selection obj, out of caret obj
  [X] caret left/right with fulltoken input
  [X] autocomplete popup / edit mode
  [X] clickable mouse position
  [X] fix event bindings lost when clicking inside textfield
  [ ] fix backspacing around edges of tokens
  [ ] write external bindings for tokenfield
    => tokenfield abstracts, interface for matching should be only multiregexp + callback
    . on change -> process tokens, apply multiregexps
    . register multiregexp
    . execute command
    
  [?] rewrite $element / $markup pattern to create new $markup on demand when doing insert/remove from DOM
  [ ] caret positions around allowempty tokens and ^/$
  [ ] caret.remove() shouldn't need to touch tokenList when pruning empties -> let triggers do it

[ ] inline autocomplete
  [X] panel overlayed on token
  [X] alignment
  [X] keyboard controls up/down
  
[ ] command stream
  [X] list of collapsible sections
  [X] host token field
  [X] context bar by command
  [ ] host output
  [ ] up/down to change focus
  [ ] anchored scrolling, auto-expand to fill view
  [ ] add forking the stream


2) Command/token autocomplete
  [X] token multi-regexp patterns
+ [.] triggers system, unify with token field triggers a bit?
  [ ] autocomplete state
  [X] autocomplete a string / command
  [ ] autocomplete filesystem
  [ ] autocomplete dir / file distinction

3) Smart output with selectable things
  [ ] Invoke a new process, capture output
  [ ] define JSON streaming format
    . content type (+ mime)
    - streaming format:
      * simple object
      * stream of objects
      * typed multipart
    . top level stream of objects
    - make test py script that streams in objects
    - transform layer, JS template output into stream
    - make a script for git (arguments, file/dir, ...)


bugs:
[ ] backspacing around token edges
[ ] autocomplete in empty token -> hit enter -> invisible
